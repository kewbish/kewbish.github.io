It's a unique nickname and the handle I use across all my work. (Bonus: No one else has used it, so I usually always get the username I want when signing up to a new platform and get fairly good search presence.)<p>Over the years, people've asked me a few times "what's a kewbish?" and "what does it mean?".</div></div><div class=wrapper><div class=grid-element><p>üö® Spoiler alert: Nothing deep.

I'd watch other Let's Players work their way through games and was even tinkering around with a few of my own. I was interested in indie gaming at the time, so I decided to record Let's Plays too.<p>Even though I was interested in gaming, that didn't mean I was good at it. Far from it - I considered myself a bit of a noob.</div></div><div class=line style=height:3rem></div><div class=emoji-block><p>üìñ</div><div class=line style=height:5rem></div><div class=wrapper><div class=grid-element><h2>The Library Nerd</h2><p>I was also a massive bookworm. I'd read at the dinner table, when we went out for shopping (shoutout Costco book section), and under my desk at school.<p>I remember going to the library every weekend and coming home with a heavy bag of books that I could barely lift.<p>I'd drag it in, plop down on the couch, and make my way through them all over the course of the week.</div></div><div class=wrapper><div class=grid-element><p>There was one book I read once, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_True_Meaning_of_Smekday><i>The True Meaning of Smekday</i></a> by Adam Rex.<p>It's about aliens and kid-friendly dystopia and weird animals. Oh, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_True_Meaning_of_Smekday#:~:text=When%20the%20car%20breaks%20down%2C%20Tip%20reluctantly%20joins%20forces%20with%20a%20fugitive%20Boov%20mechanic%20who%20had%20taken%20the%20name%20J.Lo%2C">J.Lo</a>.<p>It wasn't a life-changing book. I liked the story, and it was fun to read. But I read it, and moved on to the next in my weekly to-be-read stack.</div></div><div class=line style=height:3rem></div><div class=emoji-block><p>ü•Å</div><div class=line style=height:5rem></div><div class=wrapper><div class=grid-element><h2>Somewhat of a Poet Myself</h2><p>One day, I was thinking about nothing, when I realized something.<p>In <i>The True Meaning of Smekday</i>, there's a brief mention of a type of alien animal called a koobish. It looks like this:</div></div><img src=https://www.muddycolors.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/0f3c8-koobish.jpg alt="Koobish image." style="width:400px;margin:0 auto;object-fit:cover" width=400 height=301><div class=line style=height:2rem></div><div class=wrapper><div class=grid-element><p>Not the most friendly and cute.<p>But remember what I said about YouTube and gaming and being a noob? What if I was a <i>Noobish Koobish</i>?<p>But that looked funny - I didn't like the look of all the <kbd>o</kbd>'s. So I switched them to <kbd>ew</kbd>s.</div></div><div class=wrapper><div class=grid-element><p>And so, <i>Newbish Kewbish</i> was born. Here's the logo that I used to have for my YouTube channel.</div></div><img src=../etymology/old-logo.webp alt="Old Kewbish logo" style="width:200px;margin:0 auto;object-fit:cover" width=200 height=200><div class=line style=height:2rem></div><div class=wrapper><div class=grid-element><p>I didn't go too far with the gaming thing: I tried out lots of fun indie games on <a href=itch.io>itch.io</a> and called a video a success if it hit 10 views.<p>I got bored after a while, so kind of let it go. Come high school, my friends were OSINTing me a little too much, so I deleted the channel and all the assets, and filed many Google takedown requests to wipe the internet of the cringe.</div></div><div class=wrapper><div class=grid-element><p>I dropped the 'Newbish' part of my handle sometime after, when I started getting into web development. (I also just wanted to make sure my friends didn't dig up my old videos.)

In that sense, I think this history's comparatively a little boring.
